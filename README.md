# Washington Wildfire

Over the last year I have been very focused on Wildfires within Washington. So I thought it would be interesting to show two ways of distinguishing between the effects of wildfire within Washington. The first map is about the individual start areas that have been recorded by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) just in 2020. The second map is about the major burn areas over the last 20 years. These fires cover thousands of acres of land and leave scares on the landscape.

I want to show people that the growing issue of wildfire is pressing and needs to be taken seriously. I hope that these maps show an apparent risk towards life and property.
